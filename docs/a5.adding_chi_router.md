title: Adding Chi router
---

>💭 The [default HTTP request multiplexer](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux) in [`net/http`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) is not very powerful. For example, if you visit `localhost:8080/invalid-path` it gives the same `Hello World!` response with `200` HTTP status instead giving `404` HTTP status. There are many powerful router libraries in Go like [`gorilla/mux`](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), [`go-chi/chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), [`julienschmidt/httprouter`](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter), [`buaazp/fasthttprouter`](https://github.com/buaazp/fasthttprouter). In here, we are using [**`go-chi/chi`**](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) due to its lesser weight and extensibility.

- We need to run `go get github.com/go-chi/chi` to download and install the package. As you know, this updates `go.mod` and `go.sum` files as well.

⭐ Instead of using `cmd/app` to store all application logic, it's a good practice to create a separate package to store the main application code and call it from `cmd/app` while creating the executable. So, I am creating the **`app`** package **in the project root** for this. However, you can name this as `server` or `http`, according to the purpose of the application.

- Let's create a simple Handler which gives `Hello World!` text response. I save this under `app/app/index_handler.go`. It's a simple function which matches [`net/http`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) handler signature `func(ResponseWriter, *Request)` to pass to [`func (*ServeMux) HandleFunc`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux.HandleFunc) with a URL pattern.

> In the next steps, we are going to build a struct which contains main dependencies like DB connection, under `app/app` to use them with handlers. If you don't like the name `app/app` , I recommend you to name this as `app/server` or `server/app`.

```go
package app

import "net/http"

func HandleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
	w.Header().Set("Content-Length", "12")
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8")
	w.Header().Set("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")

	w.Write([]byte("Hello World!"))
}
```

- Then, let’s create a [new Chi router](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-chi/chi#NewRouter) and bundle our handler to `"/"` route pattern via [`MethodFunc()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-chi/chi#Mux.MethodFunc). I save this under `app/router/router.go`.

>💡 If you are not familiar with [Chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), I recommend you to read [its README](https://github.com/go-chi/chi/blob/master/README.md) for more details. If you are new to Go, again I recommend you to read the overview of the documentation of the **[`net/http`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)** package before that. As you see [MethodFunc()](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-chi/chi#Mux.MethodFunc) is matching [http.HandleFunc()](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#HandleFunc) signature.

```go
package router

import (
	"github.com/go-chi/chi"

	"myapp/app/app"
)

func New() *chi.Mux {
	r := chi.NewRouter()

	r.MethodFunc("GET", "/", app.HandleIndex)

	return r
}
```

- After that, we need to update `cmd/app/main.go` to use our Chi router instead using [default HTTP route multiplexer](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux); (Line 6, 13 and 21).

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"myapp/app/router"
	"myapp/config"
)

func main() {
	appConf := config.AppConfig()

	appRouter := router.New()

	address := fmt.Sprintf(":%d", appConf.Server.Port)

	log.Printf("Starting server %s\n", address)

	s := &http.Server{
		Addr:         address,
		Handler:      appRouter,
		ReadTimeout:  appConf.Server.TimeoutRead,
		WriteTimeout: appConf.Server.TimeoutWrite,
		IdleTimeout:  appConf.Server.TimeoutIdle,
	}
```

- Rebuild and rerun the application. You should see the same `Hello World!` response on `localhost:8080`. And this time, you should see the `404 page not found` response if you visit `localhost:8080/invalid-path`.
