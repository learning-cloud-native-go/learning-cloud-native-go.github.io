[📖](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#docker-concepts) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is **a platform** for developers and sysadmins **to develop, deploy, and run applications** with **containers**.

[📖](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) A container is **a standard unit of software** that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

>💡 If you are a newcomer to Docker, I recommend you to read [**What is a Container?**](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) article and its [**Get Started guild**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/) on its official documentation.


## Adding a Dockerfile
- I would like to store all Docker related files inside the `docker` folder in the project root, except the `docker-compose.yml`.
- We are going to add another `Dockerfile` for the database. So, let’s save this code under `docker/app/Dockerfile`.
- In here, we are using `golang:1.13-alpine` base image with `gcc`, `musl-dev`, `git`, `bash` packages.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.13-alpine
WORKDIR /myapp

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev git bash

COPY . .

RUN go build -ldflags '-w -s' -a -o ./bin/app ./cmd/app

CMD ["/myapp/bin/app"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

>🔎 Search the difference between `golang`, `golang:alpine`, `golang:stretch`, `alpine` and `stretch` Docker images.


## Adding a docker-compose.yml
[📖](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) Compose is a **tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications**. With a single command, we can create and start all the services according to the content in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

>💡 If you are new to Docker Compose, I recommend you to read its [**Get Started guild**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) on its official documentation.

As mentioned earlier, we keep the `docker-compose.yml` in the project root.

```yml
version: '3'
services:

  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/app/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

- You can use `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up` commands, to build and run the application.
- You should see `Hello World!` text while visit `localhost:8080` in the browser.


## Support Docker multi-stage builds
Docker images with the Go SDK is quite large. Because of Go is a **statically compiled language**, after creating the executable files, we don’t need the Go SDK and the codebase to run the application. 

```bash
golang      1.13-alpine      359MB
alpine      latest           5.58MB
```

Docker multi-stage build is a new feature which is using a **single Docker file** with multiple stages to **build the application in one environment** and **copy each executable and run on another environment** to reduce the resources needed in the production environment.

Let’s update the `docker/app/Dockerfile` to support multi-stage builds.

```dockerfile
# Build environment
# -----------------
FROM golang:1.13-alpine as build-env
WORKDIR /myapp

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev git

COPY . .

RUN go build -ldflags '-w -s' -a -o ./bin/app ./cmd/app


# Deployment environment
# ----------------------
FROM alpine
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache bash

COPY --from=build-env /myapp/bin/app /myapp/

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/myapp/app"]
```

>💡 If you don't like to add an extra weight to your images by installing `bash`, just use builtin `ash` or `/bin/sh` shells.

- After updating the `Dockerfile`, we need to rebuild and rerun the application.
- Always run `docker-compose down` before running `docker-compose up` to stop running containers and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images created by previous `up` commands.

>💡 The `docker images` command shows all top-level Docker images with their ID, repository name, tag name and the size. You can use the `docker rmi -f` command with the image ID to delete any old images from your system.

>💡 Better skip using Docker multi-stage builds in the development environment, due to we can reduce the build time of the second step.
