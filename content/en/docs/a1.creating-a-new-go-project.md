## Creating a remote repository
It's a good practice to save the code in a remote repository. So, I am using [github.com/learning-cloud-native-go/myapp](https://github.com/learning-cloud-native-go/myapp) to store the code.

>ğŸ’¡ You can use [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or any preferable version control repository hosting service to store the code.

In here, I prefer to use `myapp` as the project name. But you can choose a better name according to the purpose of your application.

We are going to implement this application as a [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). So, better use any folder **outside the [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)** to store the code locally. In here, I am using `dev` folder inside my home folder.

```bash
cd ~/dev
git clone git@github.com:learning-cloud-native-go/myapp.git
```


## Creating a Go module
> [ğŸ“–](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#modules) A Go module is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit. Most often, a version control repository contains exactly one module defined in the repository root. ([Multiple modules are supported in a single repository](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#faqs--multi-module-repositories), but typically that would result in more work on an on-going basis than a single module per repository).

Use `go mod init` command with the project name, inside the project folder to make it  a [Go module](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).

```bash
cd myapp
go mod init myapp
```

>ğŸ’¡ If you want to reuse this module inside another project, better use `go mod init` with either `github.com/mycompany/myapp` or `mycompany.com/myapp`.

It creates the `go.mod` file with the following content,

```go
module myapp

go 1.13
```

>ğŸ’­ In the next steps, I assume you are inside the `myapp` folder while mentioning file paths and commands to run.
