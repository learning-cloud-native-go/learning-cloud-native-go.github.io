> **👨‍🏫 Before we start...**
> - We'll run a MariaDB/ MySQL database via `docker-compose`.
> - There are few popular database migration tools in the Go ecosystem, like [`golang-migrate/migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate), [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose), [GORM migrations](http://gorm.io/docs/migration.html), etc. We choose [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose) due to its simplicity, lesser resource usage, and customizability. But, instead of using its prebuilt binaries, we'll build a custom binary with static drivers, settings, and more simplified commands.
> - ⭐ We'll store all `SQL` database migration files in the `migrations` folder in the project root.


## Database Design

In this article series, we are building a RESTful CRUD API for a simple bookshelf. To store the data, we'll use the one database table named `books` which has the following columns.

| Column Name    | Datatype     | Not Null | Auto Increment |
|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| id             | INT UNSIGNED | ✅        | ✅              |
| title          | VARCHAR(255) | ✅        |                |
| author         | VARCHAR(255) | ✅        |                |
| published_date | DATE         | ✅        |                |
| image_url      | VARCHAR(255) |          |                |
| description    | TEXT         |          |                |
| created_at     | TIMESTAMP    | ✅        |                |
| updated_at     | TIMESTAMP    |          |                |
| deleted_at     | TIMESTAMP    |          |                |


## Development Database

In this project, we use [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) as our database. But neither MariaDB nor MySQL provide official Alpine Docker images. So in here, we use [yobasystems/alpine-mariadb](https://hub.docker.com/r/yobasystems/alpine-mariadb/) MariaDB Alpine image to setup our development database.

Let's update the `docker-compose.yml` file,

```dockerfile
version: '3'
services:

  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/app/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: yobasystems/alpine-mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: myapp_root_pass
      MYSQL_DATABASE: myapp_db
      MYSQL_USER: myapp_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: myapp_pass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    restart: always
```

Run `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up` to rerun the application with the database. Or, you can run `docker-compose up db` to run only the database.

We can use `docker-compose ps` commands to see more info about the running containers.
```
NAME                COMMAND             SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
myapp-app-1         "/myapp/bin/api"    app                 running             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
myapp-db-1          "/scripts/run.sh"   db                  running             0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp
```

You can use any MariaDB client like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [Beekeeper studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io), [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to connect to the database. But still it's just an empty database, because we haven't add any database migrations so far.


## `migrate` app

### 1. Download and install the packages and dependencies

Let's run the following commands to download and install `pressly/goose` and the dependency `go-sql-driver/mysql` packages.

```go
go get github.com/pressly/goose/v3
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

The `go get` command updates the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files to store the direct and indirect dependencies of our application. You should see above packages as indirect dependencies on the `go.mod` file because still we haven't used them in our code.

```go
module myapp

go 1.19

require (
	github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.6.0 // indirect
	github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.7.0 // indirect 
)
```

This is the first time we install a third party package via the `go get` command. You should see newly created `go.sum` file with the cryptographic hashes of the above package versions.

```go
github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.6.0 h1:BCTh4TKNUYmOmMUcQ3IipzF5prigylS7XXjEkfCHuOE=
github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.6.0/go.mod h1:DCzpHaOWr8IXmIStZouvnhqoel9Qv2LBy8hT2VhHyBg=
github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.7.0 h1:jblaZul15uCIEKHRu5KUdA+5wDA7E60JC0TOthdrtf8=
github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.7.0/go.mod h1:N5gqPdIzdxf3BiPWdmoPreIwHStkxsvKWE5xjUvfYNk=
```

### 2. The `migrations` folder

As mentioned earlier, we store all `sql` database migration files in the `migrations` folder in the project root. So, let's create the `migrations` in project root.

```shell
mkdir migrations
```

### 3. `cmd/migrate/main.go`

The [`examples`](https://github.com/pressly/goose/tree/master/examples/go-migrations) folder in the Goose repository shows how to create a custom Goose binary. But we change the code a bit to tweak the CLI to make the database drivers, connection settings and `migrations` folder fixed and make the commands more user-friendly.

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
	"github.com/pressly/goose/v3"
)

const (
	dialect  = "mysql"
	host     = "localhost"
	port     = 3306
	user     = "myapp_user"
	password = "myapp_pass"
	database = "myapp_db"
)

var (
	flags = flag.NewFlagSet("migrate", flag.ExitOnError)
	dir   = flags.String("dir", "migrations", "directory with migration files")
)

func main() {
	flags.Usage = usage
	flags.Parse(os.Args[1:])

	args := flags.Args()
	if len(args) == 0 || args[0] == "-h" || args[0] == "--help" {
		flags.Usage()
		return
	}

	command := args[0]

	cfg := &mysql.Config{
		Net:                  "tcp",
		Addr:                 fmt.Sprintf("%v:%v", host, port),
		DBName:               database,
		User:                 user,
		Passwd:               password,
		AllowNativePasswords: true,
		ParseTime:            true,
	}

	db, err := goose.OpenDBWithDriver(dialect, cfg.FormatDSN())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(err.Error())
	}

	defer func() {
		if err := db.Close(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf(err.Error())
		}
	}()

	if err := goose.Run(command, db, *dir, args[1:]...); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("migrate %v: %v", command, err)
	}
}

func usage() {
	fmt.Println(usagePrefix)
	flags.PrintDefaults()
	fmt.Println(usageCommands)
}

var (
	usagePrefix = `Usage: migrate COMMAND
Examples:
    migrate status
`

	usageCommands = `
Commands:
    up                   Migrate the DB to the most recent version available
    up-by-one            Migrate the DB up by 1
    up-to VERSION        Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION
    down                 Roll back the version by 1
    down-to VERSION      Roll back to a specific VERSION
    redo                 Re-run the latest migration
    reset                Roll back all migrations
    status               Dump the migration status for the current DB
    version              Print the current version of the database
    create NAME [sql|go] Creates new migration file with the current timestamp
    fix                  Apply sequential ordering to migrations`
)
```


## `migrate` commands

### `migrate -h`
We can use `go run ./cmd/migrate -h` to test it locally. You should see the list of commands it supports.

```
Usage: migrate COMMAND
Examples:
    migrate status

  -dir string
        directory with migration files (default "migrations")

Commands:
    up                   Migrate the DB to the most recent version available
    up-by-one            Migrate the DB up by 1
    up-to VERSION        Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION
    down                 Roll back the version by 1
    down-to VERSION      Roll back to a specific VERSION
    redo                 Re-run the latest migration
    reset                Roll back all migrations
    status               Dump the migration status for the current DB
    version              Print the current version of the database
    create NAME [sql|go] Creates new migration file with the current timestamp
    fix                  Apply sequential ordering to migrations
```

### `migrate version`

Database migrations are like version controls for the database. When you run `go run ./cmd/migrate version`, you should see the timestamp of your current time and `goose: version 0` text. If you checked the `myapp_db` database, you should see the new table `goose_db_version` with a `version_id: 0` record.

### `migrate status`

With `go run ./cmd/migrate status`, we can see more detailed list of migrations. But, because we haven't added any migrations so far, it will be an empty list with the current timestamp and headings.

```shell
2019/08/05 09:00:00     Applied At                  Migration
2019/08/05 09:00:00     =======================================
```

### `migrate create`
Let's create our first migration file by running `go run ./cmd/migrate create create_books_table sql`. This will create the `create_books_table.sql` file with the prefix of current timestamp (ex. `20190805170000_create_books_table.sql`) inside the `migrations` folder with the following content.

```sql
-- +goose Up
-- +goose StatementBegin
SELECT 'up SQL query';
-- +goose StatementEnd

-- +goose Down
-- +goose StatementBegin
SELECT 'down SQL query';
-- +goose StatementEnd

```

### `migrate fix`

We can keep migration files/ version numbers either in timestamps or simpler numeric values like 1, 2, 3, etc. By running 
`go run ./cmd/migrate fix`, our first migration file will be renamed to `00001_create_books_table.sql`.

```sql
RENAMED 20190805170000_create_books_table.sql => 00001_create_books_table.sql
```

### Other commands

>💡We will discuss the remaining commands like `migrate up`, `migrate down`, `migrate reset`, after update our migration file with actual SQL.


## SQL migrations

Let's update our `00001_create_books_table.sql` file with the actual SQL. In the `+goose Up` section, we should add the `CREATE TABLE` script and in the `+goose Down` section, we should add the `DROP TABLE` script.

```sql
-- +goose Up
-- SQL in this section is executed when the migration is applied.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books
(
    id             INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title          VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author         VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    published_date DATE         NOT NULL,
    image_url      VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    description    TEXT         NULL,
    created_at     TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
    updated_at     TIMESTAMP    NULL,
    deleted_at     TIMESTAMP    NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- +goose Down
-- SQL in this section is executed when the migration is rolled back.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
```

With the newly added SQL migration, when you run `go run ./cmd/migrate status`, you should see the `Pending` migration now.

```shell
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Applied At                  Migration
2019/08/05 17:00:00     =======================================
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Pending                  -- 00001_create_books_table.sql
```

## Running migrations

### `migrate up` 

To apply our migration, let's run `go run ./cmd/migrate up`. Now, you should see new table `books` and new record on `goose_db_version` with id: 2 and `version_id` : 1.

Also, with `go run ./cmd/migrate status`, now you should the details of the applied migration.

```shell
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Applied At                  Migration
2019/08/05 17:00:00     =======================================
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Mon Aug  5 17:00:00 2019 -- 00001_create_books_table.sql
```

> 💡As you can see with the `go run ./cmd/migrate -h`,
> - `migrate up-by-one`     Migrate the DB up by 1
> - `migrate up-to VERSION` Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION

### `migrate down` 

If you run, `go run ./cmd/migrate down`, the last migration will be rolled back and you will see the `Pending` migration with the `migrate status` command.

> 💡As you can see with the `go run ./cmd/migrate -h`,
> - `migrate down`             Roll back the version by 1
> - `migrate down-to VERSION`  Roll back to a specific VERSION
> - `migrate redo`             Re-run the latest migration
> - `migrate reset`            Roll back all migrations

## 👨‍🏫 What's next…
If you try to run `./bin/migrate up` inside the docker image, it will give the following error; `migrate up: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:3306: connect: connection refused`. This is because we hardcoded `const host = "localhost"` in the `cmd/migrate/main.go` but the Docker network assigns a different IP address to each container.

> 💡We can check the IP of the MariaDB Docker container, by using the `docker exec myapp-db-1 cat /etc/hosts` command.

In the next article, we'll configure our application and run database migrations on application start.
