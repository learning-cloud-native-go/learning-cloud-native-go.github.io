> - We'll run a Postgres database via `docker-compose`.
> - There are a few popular database migration tools in the Go ecosystem, like [`golang-migrate/migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate), [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose), [GORM migrations](http://gorm.io/docs/migration.html), etc. We selected [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose) due to its simplicity, lesser resource usage, and customizability. But, instead of using its prebuilt binaries, we'll build a custom binary with static drivers, settings, and more simplified commands.

## Database Design

In this article series, we are building a RESTful CRUD API for a simple bookshelf. We'll use the [Postgres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) database and a table called "books" to store the data, which has the following columns.

| Column Name    | Datatype  | Not Null | Primary Key |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| id             | UUID      | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ           |
| title          | TEXT      | ‚úÖ        |             |
| author         | TEXT      | ‚úÖ        |             |
| published_date | DATE      | ‚úÖ        |             |
| image_url      | TEXT      |          |             |
| description    | TEXT      |          |             |
| created_at     | TIMESTAMP | ‚úÖ        |             |
| updated_at     | TIMESTAMP | ‚úÖ        |             |
| deleted_at     | TIMESTAMP |          |             |


## Development Database

We'll use the [official Postgres Alpine Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) to build our development database.

Let's update the `compose.yml` file,

```dockerfile
services:

  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=myapp_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myapp_pass
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    restart: always
```

Run `docker compose down` and `docker compose up` to rerun the application with the database. Or, you can run `docker compose up db` to run only the database.

We can use `docker compose ps` commands to see more info about the running containers.

```
NAME                COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
myapp-app-1         "/myapp/bin/api"         app                 running             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
myapp-db-1          "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   db                  running             0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
```

You can use any PostgreSQL client like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [Beekeeper studio](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio) to connect to the database. But still it's just an empty database, because we haven't add any database migrations so far.


## `migrate` app

### 1. The `migrations` folder

As mentioned earlier, we store all `sql` database migration files in the `migrations` folder in the project root. So, let's create the `migrations` in project root.

```shell
mkdir migrations
```

### 2. Download and install the packages and dependencies

Let's run the following commands to download and install `pressly/goose` and the dependency `jackc/pgx` packages.

```go
go get github.com/pressly/goose/v3
go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v5
```

The `go get` command updates the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files to store the direct and indirect dependencies of our application. You should see above packages as indirect dependencies on the `go.mod` file because still we haven't used them in our code.

```go
module myapp

go 1.19

require (
    github.com/jackc/pgpassfile v1.0.0 // indirect
    github.com/jackc/pgservicefile v0.0.0-20221227161230-091c0ba34f0a // indirect
    github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.2.0 // indirect
    github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.8.0 // indirect
    golang.org/x/crypto v0.5.0 // indirect
    golang.org/x/text v0.6.0 // indirect
)

```

This is the first time we install a third party package via the `go get` command. You should see newly created `go.sum` file with the cryptographic hashes of the above package versions.

### 3. `cmd/migrate/main.go`

The [`examples`](https://github.com/pressly/goose/tree/master/examples/go-migrations) folder in the Goose repository shows how to create a custom Goose binary. But we change the code a bit to tweak the CLI to make the database drivers, connection settings and `migrations` folder fixed and make the commands more user-friendly.

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	_ "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib"
	"github.com/pressly/goose/v3"
)

const (
	dialect  = "pgx"
	dbString = "host=localhost user=myapp_user password=myapp_pass dbname=myapp_db port=5432 sslmode=disable"
)

var (
	flags = flag.NewFlagSet("migrate", flag.ExitOnError)
	dir   = flags.String("dir", "migrations", "directory with migration files")
)

func main() {
	flags.Usage = usage
	flags.Parse(os.Args[1:])

	args := flags.Args()
	if len(args) == 0 || args[0] == "-h" || args[0] == "--help" {
		flags.Usage()
		return
	}

	command := args[0]

	db, err := goose.OpenDBWithDriver(dialect, dbString)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(err.Error())
	}

	defer func() {
		if err := db.Close(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf(err.Error())
		}
	}()

	if err := goose.Run(command, db, *dir, args[1:]...); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("migrate %v: %v", command, err)
	}
}

func usage() {
	fmt.Println(usagePrefix)
	flags.PrintDefaults()
	fmt.Println(usageCommands)
}

var (
	usagePrefix = `Usage: migrate COMMAND
Examples:
    migrate status
`

	usageCommands = `
Commands:
    up                   Migrate the DB to the most recent version available
    up-by-one            Migrate the DB up by 1
    up-to VERSION        Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION
    down                 Roll back the version by 1
    down-to VERSION      Roll back to a specific VERSION
    redo                 Re-run the latest migration
    reset                Roll back all migrations
    status               Dump the migration status for the current DB
    version              Print the current version of the database
    create NAME [sql|go] Creates new migration file with the current timestamp
    fix                  Apply sequential ordering to migrations`
)
```

### 4. Run `go mod tidy`

[üìñ](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-tidy) `go mod tidy` ensures that the `go.mod` file matches the source code in the module. It adds any missing module requirements necessary to build the current module‚Äôs packages and dependencies, and it removes requirements on modules that don‚Äôt provide any relevant packages. It also adds any missing entries to `go.sum` and removes unnecessary entries.

After running `go mod tidy`, the `jackc/pgx` and `pressly/goose` packages should appear as direct dependencies in the `go.mod` file, because we now use them in `cmd/migrate/main.go` file.

```go
module myapp

go 1.19

require (
	github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.2.0
	github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.8.0
)

require (
	github.com/jackc/pgpassfile v1.0.0 // indirect
	github.com/jackc/pgservicefile v0.0.0-20221227161230-091c0ba34f0a // indirect
	golang.org/x/crypto v0.5.0 // indirect
	golang.org/x/text v0.6.0 // indirect
)
```

### 5. Update `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine

WORKDIR /myapp
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .

RUN go build -o ./bin/api ./cmd/api \
    && go build -o ./bin/migrate ./cmd/migrate

CMD ["/myapp/bin/api"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

Few important things here,
- We run [`go mod download`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-download) with the local [module cache](https://go.dev/ref/mod#glos-module-cache) and then copy to the docker image.
- We build the `migrate` app binary inside the `bin` folder.


## `migrate` commands

> ‚≠êÔ∏è If you try to run `./bin/migrate up` inside the docker image, it will give the following error; `migrate up: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:3306: connect: connection refused`. This is because we hardcoded `const dbString = "host=localhost ..."` in the `cmd/migrate/main.go` but the Docker network assigns a different IP address to each container (üí°Use `docker exec myapp-db-1 cat /etc/hosts` to check the IP of the Postgres Docker container).
> 
> ‚≠ê As a result, we can't test `migrate` commands other than `./bin/migrate -h` inside the docker image until we configure our applications in the next article. Until then, let's run `migrate` commands directly, via `go run ./cmd/migrate`.

### `migrate -h`
We can use `go run ./cmd/migrate -h` to test it locally. You should see the list of commands it supports.

```
Usage: migrate COMMAND
Examples:
    migrate status

  -dir string
        directory with migration files (default "migrations")

Commands:
    up                   Migrate the DB to the most recent version available
    up-by-one            Migrate the DB up by 1
    up-to VERSION        Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION
    down                 Roll back the version by 1
    down-to VERSION      Roll back to a specific VERSION
    redo                 Re-run the latest migration
    reset                Roll back all migrations
    status               Dump the migration status for the current DB
    version              Print the current version of the database
    create NAME [sql|go] Creates new migration file with the current timestamp
    fix                  Apply sequential ordering to migrations
```

### `migrate version`

Database migrations are like version controls for the database. When you run `go run ./cmd/migrate version`, you should see the timestamp of your current time and `goose: version 0` text. If you checked the `myapp_db` database, you should see the new table `goose_db_version` with a `version_id: 0` record.

### `migrate status`

With `go run ./cmd/migrate status`, we can see more detailed list of migrations. But, because we haven't added any migrations so far, it will be an empty list with the current timestamp and headings.

```shell
2019/08/05 09:00:00     Applied At                  Migration
2019/08/05 09:00:00     =======================================
```

### `migrate create`
Let's create our first migration file by running `go run ./cmd/migrate create create_books_table sql`. This will create the `create_books_table.sql` file with the prefix of current timestamp (ex. `20190805170000_create_books_table.sql`) inside the `migrations` folder with the following content.

```sql
-- +goose Up
-- +goose StatementBegin
SELECT 'up SQL query';
-- +goose StatementEnd

-- +goose Down
-- +goose StatementBegin
SELECT 'down SQL query';
-- +goose StatementEnd

```

### `migrate fix`

We can keep migration files/ version numbers either in timestamps or simpler numeric values like 1, 2, 3, etc. By running 
`go run ./cmd/migrate fix`, our first migration file will be renamed to `00001_create_books_table.sql`.

```sql
RENAMED 20190805170000_create_books_table.sql => 00001_create_books_table.sql
```

### Other commands

>üí°We will discuss the remaining commands like `migrate up`, `migrate down`, `migrate reset`, after update our migration file with actual SQL.


## SQL migrations

Let's update our `00001_create_books_table.sql` file with the actual SQL. In the `+goose Up` section, we should add the `CREATE TABLE` script and in the `+goose Down` section, we should add the `DROP TABLE` script.

```sql
-- +goose Up
-- SQL in this section is executed when the migration is applied.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books
(
    id             UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title          TEXT      NOT NULL,
    author         TEXT      NOT NULL,
    published_date DATE      NOT NULL,
    image_url      TEXT      NULL,
    description    TEXT      NULL,
    created_at     TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at     TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    deleted_at     TIMESTAMP NULL
);

-- +goose Down
-- SQL in this section is executed when the migration is rolled back.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
```

With the newly added SQL migration, when you run `go run ./cmd/migrate status`, you should see the `Pending` migration now.

```shell
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Applied At                  Migration
2019/08/05 17:00:00     =======================================
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Pending                  -- 00001_create_books_table.sql
```

## Running migrations

### `migrate up` 

To apply our migration, let's run `go run ./cmd/migrate up`. Now, you should see new table `books` and new record on `goose_db_version` with id: 2 and `version_id` : 1.

Also, with `go run ./cmd/migrate status`, now you should the details of the applied migration.

```shell
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Applied At                  Migration
2019/08/05 17:00:00     =======================================
2019/08/05 17:00:00     Mon Aug  5 17:00:00 2019 -- 00001_create_books_table.sql
```

> üí°As you can see with the `go run ./cmd/migrate -h`,
> - `migrate up-by-one`     Migrate the DB up by 1
> - `migrate up-to VERSION` Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION

### `migrate down` 

If you run, `go run ./cmd/migrate down`, the last migration will be rolled back and you will see the `Pending` migration with the `migrate status` command.

> üí°As you can see with the `go run ./cmd/migrate -h`,
> - `migrate down`             Roll back the version by 1
> - `migrate down-to VERSION`  Roll back to a specific VERSION
> - `migrate redo`             Re-run the latest migration
> - `migrate reset`            Roll back all migrations
