> **👨‍🏫 Before we start...**
> - We'll run a MariaDB/ MySQL database via the `docker-compose`.
> - There are few popular database migration tools in the Go ecosystem like [`golang-migrate/migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate), [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose), [GORM migrations](http://gorm.io/docs/migration.html) and, etc. We choose [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose) due to its simplicity, lesser resource usage and customizability. But, instead of using its prebuild binaries, we'll build a custom binary with static drivers, settings and more simplified commands.
> - ⭐ We'll store all `sql` database migration files in the `migrations` folder in the project root.


## Development Database

In this project, we use [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) as our database. But neither MariaDB nor MySQL provide official Alpine Docker images. So in here, we use [yobasystems/alpine-mariadb](https://hub.docker.com/r/yobasystems/alpine-mariadb/) MariaDB Alpine image to setup our development database.

Let's update the `docker-compose.yml` file,

```dockerfile
version: '3'
services:

  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./docker/app/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: yobasystems/alpine-mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: myapp_root_pass
      MYSQL_DATABASE: myapp_db
      MYSQL_USER: myapp_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: myapp_pass
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    restart: always
```

Run `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up` to rerun the application with the database. Or, you can run `docker-compose up db` to run only the database.

We can use `docker-compose ps` commands to see more info about the running containers.
```
NAME                COMMAND             SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
myapp-app-1         "/myapp/bin/app"    app                 running             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
myapp-db-1          "/scripts/run.sh"   db                  running             0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp
```

You can use any MariaDB client like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to connect to the database. But still it's just an empty database, because we haven't add any database migrations so far.


## `migrate` app

### 1. Download and install the packages and dependencies

Let's run the following commands to download and install `pressly/goose` and the dependency `go-sql-driver/mysql` packages.

```go
go get github.com/pressly/goose/v3
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

The `go get` command updates the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files to store the direct and indirect dependencies of our application. You should see above packages as indirect dependencies on the `go.mod` file because still we haven't used them in our code.

```go
module myapp

go 1.19

require (
	github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.6.0 // indirect
	github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.7.0 // indirect 
)
```

This is the first time we install a third party package via the `go get` command. You should see newly created `go.sum` file with the cryptographic hashes of the above package versions.

```go
github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.6.0 h1:BCTh4TKNUYmOmMUcQ3IipzF5prigylS7XXjEkfCHuOE=
github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.6.0/go.mod h1:DCzpHaOWr8IXmIStZouvnhqoel9Qv2LBy8hT2VhHyBg=
github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.7.0 h1:jblaZul15uCIEKHRu5KUdA+5wDA7E60JC0TOthdrtf8=
github.com/pressly/goose/v3 v3.7.0/go.mod h1:N5gqPdIzdxf3BiPWdmoPreIwHStkxsvKWE5xjUvfYNk=
```

### 2. The `migrations` folder

As mentioned earlier, we store all `sql` database migration files in the `migrations` folder in the project root. So, let's create the `migrations` in project root.

```shell
mkdir migrations
```

### 3. `cmd/migrate/main.go`

The [`examples`](https://github.com/pressly/goose/tree/master/examples/go-migrations) folder in the Goose repository shows how to create a custom Goose binary. But we change the code a bit to tweak the CLI to make the database drivers, connection settings and `migrations` folder fixed and make the commands more user-friendly.

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
	"github.com/pressly/goose/v3"
)

const (
	dialect  = "mysql"
	host     = "localhost"
	port     = 3306
	user     = "myapp_user"
	password = "myapp_pass"
	database = "myapp_db"
)

var (
	flags = flag.NewFlagSet("migrate", flag.ExitOnError)
	dir   = flags.String("dir", "migrations", "directory with migration files")
)

func main() {
	flags.Usage = usage
	flags.Parse(os.Args[1:])

	args := flags.Args()
	if len(args) == 0 || args[0] == "-h" || args[0] == "--help" {
		flags.Usage()
		return
	}

	command := args[0]

	cfg := &mysql.Config{
		Net:                  "tcp",
		Addr:                 fmt.Sprintf("%v:%v", host, port),
		DBName:               database,
		User:                 user,
		Passwd:               password,
		AllowNativePasswords: true,
		ParseTime:            true,
	}

	db, err := goose.OpenDBWithDriver(dialect, cfg.FormatDSN())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf(err.Error())
	}

	defer func() {
		if err := db.Close(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalf(err.Error())
		}
	}()

	if err := goose.Run(command, db, *dir, args[1:]...); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("migrate %v: %v", command, err)
	}
}

func usage() {
	fmt.Println(usagePrefix)
	flags.PrintDefaults()
	fmt.Println(usageCommands)
}

var (
	usagePrefix = `Usage: migrate COMMAND
Examples:
    migrate status
`

	usageCommands = `
Commands:
    up                   Migrate the DB to the most recent version available
    up-by-one            Migrate the DB up by 1
    up-to VERSION        Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION
    down                 Roll back the version by 1
    down-to VERSION      Roll back to a specific VERSION
    redo                 Re-run the latest migration
    reset                Roll back all migrations
    status               Dump the migration status for the current DB
    version              Print the current version of the database
    create NAME [sql|go] Creates new migration file with the current timestamp
    fix                  Apply sequential ordering to migrations`
)
```

We can use `go run ./cmd/migrate -h` to test it locally. You should see the list of commands it supports.

```
Usage: migrate COMMAND
Examples:
    migrate status

  -dir string
        directory with migration files (default "migrations")

    up                   Migrate the DB to the most recent version available
    up-by-one            Migrate the DB up by 1
    up-to VERSION        Migrate the DB to a specific VERSION
    down                 Roll back the version by 1
    down-to VERSION      Roll back to a specific VERSION
    redo                 Re-run the latest migration
    reset                Roll back all migrations
    status               Dump the migration status for the current DB
    version              Print the current version of the database
    create NAME [sql|go] Creates new migration file with the current timestamp

```
