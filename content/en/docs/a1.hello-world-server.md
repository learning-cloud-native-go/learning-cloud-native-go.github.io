> **👨‍🏫** **Before we start...**
> - Go comes with the [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package, which provides HTTP client and server implementations. So,
> - We'll start with the examples of the standard library documentation. 
> - Then, we will Dockerize and rearrange the files with an idiomatic project structure.
> - ⭐ We use `myapp` as the project name/ project root folder name.

## `ListenAndServe`

> [📖 `ListenAndServe`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ListenAndServe) listens on the TCP network address addr and then calls Serve with handler to handle requests on incoming connections. Accepted connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

Let’s save this code under `main.go`.

```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", hello)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func hello (w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, "Hello, world!")
}
```

- Use `go run ./main.go` command, to run it locally. 
- You should see `Hello, world!` text while visit [localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello) in the browser.


## `NewServeMux`

> [📖 `ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux) ServeMux is an HTTP request multiplexer. It matches the URL of each incoming request against a list of registered patterns and calls the handler for the pattern that most closely matches the URL.
> [`NewServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#NewServeMux) allocates and returns a new ServeMux.
> 
> 💡 Because, default `ServeMux` is very limited and not very performant.

Let's update the `main.go` with the following code.

```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/hello", hello)

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux)
}

func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, "Hello, world!")
}
```

- Same way, use the `go run ./main.go` command, to run it locally.
- You should see the same response, `Hello, world!` text while visit [localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello) in the browser.


## `Server`

> [📖 `Server`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server) A Server defines parameters for running an HTTP server. 

Let's update the `main.go` and see how we can change default timeout configs of the `Server`.

```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/hello", hello)

	s := &http.Server{
		Addr:         ":8080",
		Handler:      mux,
		ReadTimeout:  2 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 2 * time.Second,
		IdleTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
	}

	s.ListenAndServe()
}

func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, "Hello, world!")
}
```

- You should see the same response, `Hello, world!` in the browser.
- To verify the functionality, you can use [`time.Sleep()`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Sleep) function and after 2 seconds the server will automatically break the connection.

```go
func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	io.WriteString(w, "Hello, world!")
}
```


## Logs and error handling

Let's update the `main.go` to see how we can add some logs and handle the basic errors of the above code.

```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/hello", hello)

	s := &http.Server{
		Addr:         ":8080",
		Handler:      mux,
		ReadTimeout:  2 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 2 * time.Second,
		IdleTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
	}

	log.Println("Starting server :8080")
	if err := s.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
		log.Fatal("Server startup failed")
	}
}

func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, "Hello, world!")
}
```


## `Dockerfile`

> [📖 Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#docker-concepts) is **a platform** for developers and sysadmins **to develop, deploy, and run applications** with **containers**. [A container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) is **a standard unit of software** that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 🔍 If you are a newcomer to Docker, I recommend you to read [**What is a Container?**](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) article and its [**Get Started guild**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/) on its official documentation and install the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Let’s add the `Dockerfile`. We use [official Go Docker alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) to test our server.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine

WORKDIR /myapp
COPY . .

RUN go build main.go

CMD ["/myapp/main"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

- To build the Docker image: `docker build -t myapp .`
- To run: `docker run -dp 8080:8080 myapp`
- You should see the same response, `Hello, world!` text while visit [localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello) in the browser.

> 💡 Docker generates a random name for our container, unless we set a custom name via the `--name` flag. 
> We can use `docker ps` command to see more info. To stop the container `docker stop <name>` and to remove the image `docker rmi -f <image-id>`.


## `docker-compose.yml`

> [📖 Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a **tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications**. With a single command, we can create and start all the services according to the content in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 🔍 If you are new to Docker Compose, I recommend you to read its [**Get Started guild**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) on its official documentation.

Let’s add the `docker-compose.yml`.

```dockerfile
version: '3'
services:

  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

- You can use `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up` commands, to build and run the application.
- You should see the same response, `Hello, world!` text while visit [localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello) in the browser.
- Use the `docker-compose down` command to stop the application.


## An idiomatic structure
Let's arrange the files to follow an idiomatic project structure.

### 1. `go.mod`

> [📖 A Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#modules) is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit. Most often, a version control repository contains exactly one module defined in the repository root. ([Multiple modules are supported in a single repository](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#faqs--multi-module-repositories), but typically that would result in more work on an on-going basis than a single module per repository).

You can create the `go.mod` by running `go mod init myapp`. It will generate the `go.mod` file in the project root with the module name and the Go version of your system.

```go
module myapp

go 1.19
```

### 2. `cmd` and `bin` folders

It's common to have multiple buildable binaries in a single project. Even in our project, we will add another executable to run the database migrations. It's a good practice to store all these buildable binaries as subfolders inside the `cmd` folder and store all binaries inside the `bin` folder

- First, let's move the `main.go` file to `cmd/api/main.go`

- Then, let's update the `Dockerfile` to update the paths.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine

WORKDIR /myapp
COPY . .

RUN go build -o ./bin/api ./cmd/api

CMD ["/myapp/bin/api"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

By changing `RUN go build main.go` to `RUN go build -o ./bin/api ./cmd/api`, we have updated few important things. 
1. While running `go build`, we target `/cmd/api` directory instead of `main.go` file. 
   - So, we can divide the code into multiple files if needed.
2. We store the compiled binary inside the `bin` folder. 
   - Adding the `-o` flag is necessary because the `bin` folder needs to create with the binary.


## 📁 Final project structure

```shell
myapp
├── cmd
│  └── api
│     └── main.go
│
├── go.mod
│
├── docker-compose.yml
└── Dockerfile
```


## 👨‍🏫 What's next…

In the next article, we'll connect a database and add database migrations to our application.
