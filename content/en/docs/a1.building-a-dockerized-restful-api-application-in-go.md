## 👨‍🏫 On this project...

- We build a Dockerized RESTful API application in Go step by step.
- We'll start from the Go standard library `net/http` package, create a basic server app, and Dockerize it.
- Then, we'll add a database, DB migration SQL files, and create the `migrate` app to run these migration files.
- ...


## 📦 The codebase

- The codebase of the completed project can be found in [learning-cloud-native-go/myapp](http://github.com/learning-cloud-native-go/myapp) GitHub repository.
- The completed API application supports the following API endpoints.
